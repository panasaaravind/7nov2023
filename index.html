        <p>Indian fans aren't exactly unfamiliar with bizarre cricketing dismissals. Steve Waugh getting out for ‘handling the ball’ in Chennai in the famous 2001 Border-Gavaskar series immediately rings a bell. Inzamam-ul-Haq's dismissal for ‘obstructing the field’ as Suresh Raina threw the ball towards the stumps in Peshawar 2006 was another such instance.

        </p>
        <p>Monday saw another such occurrence as Sri Lanka all-rounder Angelo Mathews became the first international cricketer to be ‘timed out’ in the fifth and final game of the ongoing World Cup at the Feroze Shah Kotla.

        <p>The unique dismissal, and the following controversy, completely overshadowed Bangladesh’s three-wicket victory that knocked Sri Lanka out of the semi-final race. The instance eclipsed Charith Asalanka’s fantastic 105-ball 108 that guided Sri Lanka to 279 in 49.3 overs. It also put in the shade Najmul Hossain Shanto (90) and Shakib Al Hasan’s (82) 169-run third wicket stand that ended Bangladesh’s streak of six successive defeats with 8.5 overs to spare.
