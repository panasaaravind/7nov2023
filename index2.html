        <p>If Virat Kohli hadn't made his 35th birthday memorable already by scoring a 49th century in ODIs, Sachin Tendulkar sure made it special. With the entire world waiting with bated breath for Kohli to go level-pecking with the legendary Tendulkar, the moment finally arrived when a backfoot punch for a single gave Kohli his 4th World Cup ton â€“ first against South Africa. But the icing on the cake came approximately 10 minutes later, when the genius himself sent out a special message for Kohli.

        <p>"Well played Virat. It took me 365 days to go from 49 to 50 earlier this year. I hope you go from 49 to 50 and break my record in the next few days. Congratulations," Tendulkar wrote on X.
